## 🌌 Why MetaEngines?

MetaEngines was born from lived experience.  
It’s a toolkit for those who feel everything, process differently, and build inner systems to survive a chaotic world.  
Created in collaboration with GPT, this project is a mirror and an engine for the neurodivergent mind.

*This is not productivity. This is personal transformation.*
